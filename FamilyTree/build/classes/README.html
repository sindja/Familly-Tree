<h3>Installation</h3>
The distribution includes no development environment specific
configuration or makefiles.
<p>
To run the applets doesn't require any further installation steps.
Refer to the <a href=documentation/samples.html>samples</a> to view the sample
applets.
<p>
To run the sample applications you should include the JHotDraw directory
in your CLASSPATH. <b>Note</b> using a relative path to refer to JHotDraw
can result in class loading errors. You run into this problem when the application's
working directory is changed with a file dialog.
